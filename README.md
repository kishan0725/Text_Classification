# Text_Classification
Classify texts into different groups based on which category they belong to using Naive Bayes

## What is Naive Bayes?
  It is called 'Naive' because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn to be correct.
  Bayes is the name of an English clergyman and mathematician, Thomas Bayes.
